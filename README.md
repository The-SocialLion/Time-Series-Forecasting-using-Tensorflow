# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-Tensorflow
This repository is dedicated to hold two different colab notebooks which follow different principles and render the required results.

**TASK-2-nb1.ipynb file:** renderes the results of all the models , when the data is not scaled i.e( feature scaling is not applied to the dataset)

**TASK-2-nb2.ipynb file :** renders the reults of all the models , when the data is scaled i.e(feature scaling is applied to the dataset)

**I would also like to point out that this was the problem statement assigned to me after the results were verified for the solution constructed in the first round (Data Analysis/Validation using Autogluon API) during the assesment of my skills as the role of intern for the company.**

**Thank you**
